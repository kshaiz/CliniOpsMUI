      <Typography variant="body1">Clinical trials came to a complete standstill after CoronaVirus hit worldwide, as the impact of the virus has hit hospitals hard. Research has been forced to take a back seat because the hospitals (sites) did not want non critical care patients to visit the sites at all. Countries around the world have executed shelter-in-place policies, shutting businesses down and the impact was deeply felt by the clinical research industry.</Typography>

But those efforts could disguise a cost to public health, too, in the form of stalled progress on experimental medicines for other diseases.</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ mt: 1 }}>Since March, 2020, nearly 100* companies have reported some sort of disruption to a clinical trial as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Key among the issues faced by the Clinical Trials was the risk of having your patient visit a medical site during the pandemic. But with the eSource platform already deployed and used widely, CliniOps Clinical Operations DeCentralized Clinical Trial platform promises to restart the stalled trials worldwide.</Typography>
